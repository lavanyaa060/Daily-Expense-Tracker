PROJECT REPORT

DAILY EXPENSE TRACKER


Aim:

To create a working application that helps students record and manage their daily expenses by applying the concepts learned in Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming course.


Problem Definition:

Many students,including me,face difficulty in keeping track of how much money we spend every day. We usually buy food,small items and later we forget where money went.So,I created this small program which helps in recording daily expenses in one place so that I can see where I spend money.


Project requirements:

1.Coding platform like visual code studio
2.python


Expected Outcome:

After completing the project, the program will:
Allow users to input their daily expenses
Show all the expenses
Show total amount spent
Help users keep records of their expenses


Top-Down Design:

1.Start
2.Create function to add expense
3.Create function to show expense list
4.Create function to calculate total money spent
5.Exit


Algorithm:

1.Start
2.Create list called expenses
3.Display main screen with options
4.Ask user to input expenses
5.Store in list
6.If user selects “Show Expenses”
   Display all entries
7.End

Implementation:

This project uses:-
Lists for storing data
Functions for different tasks
Simple maths for calculating expenses


Future Enhancements:

In future,this program can add these changes:
Categories (food, travel, etc.) for more organized expense record
Editing or deleting expense
Monthly expense data


Conclusion:

This project helped me understand how basic python programming concepts can be used to solve everyday problems. By using these concepts I was able to create small working application which helps in managing daily expenses
